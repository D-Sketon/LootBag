# Loot Bag

Foliet's First Mod

Every time you kill a monster, there is a **4%** chance to drop a loot bag, you can modify the chance in the configuration file

Right-click to open the loot bag to pick up all the loot from a random loot chest or get an extra gift

## The list of possible loot table includes:

- **Jungle Temple**
- **Woodland Mansion**
- **Simple Dungeon**
- **Stronghold Library**
- **Ruined Portal**
- **Desert Pyramid**
- **Abandoned Mineshaft**
- **Stronghold Corridor**
- **Buried Treasure**
- **Bastion Treasure**
- **End City Treasure**
- **Shipwreck Treasure**
- **Extra Gift**

**Extra Gift** can be a practical item, a powerful weapon or something else. Anyway, it won't let you down!

Until now, what you can find is just a backpack. A container that can be opened in the hand

In the future, more interesting items such as a key which is able to open a chest remotely would be added into the mod

## TODO

- Spawn different loot bag in the different biomes
- Add more unique and practical items to the loot bag

Please comment on this mod if you have any suggestions for improvement of it. I would be grateful to your idea :D
