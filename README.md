# Loot Bag
Foliet's First Mod

A nice loot bag mod

Every time you kill a monster, there is a **2%** chance to drop a loot bag

Right-click to open the loot bag to randomly draw a loot table from the wreck ruins and other chests, and draw **10** loot from it

The drop probability and the number of draws can be modified in the configuration file
