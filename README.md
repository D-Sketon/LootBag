# Loot Bag
Foliet's First Mod

A nice loot bag mod

Every time you kill a monster, there is a **2%** chance to drop a loot bag

Right-click to open the loot bag to randomly draw a loot table from a random loot chest, and pick **10** loot from it

## The list of possible loot includes:

- **Village Armored**
- **Shipwreck Treasure**
- **Jungle Temple**
- **Woodland Mansion**
- **Simple Dungeon**
- **Stronghold Library**
- **Ruined Portal**
- **Desert Pyramid**
- **Abandoned Mineshaft**
- **Buried Treasure**
- **Bastion Treasure**
- **Stronghold Corridor**
- **End City Treasure**

## TODO

- Spawn different loot bag in the different biomes
- Allow player to select which loot tables should be chosen
- Add several unique and practical items to the loot bag

The drop probability and the number of picks can be modified in the configuration file

Please comment on this mod if you have any suggestions for improvement of it. I would be grateful to your idea :D
